 <h2>Physcial Science</h2>
 <h3>-Introduction-</h3>

<p>Physical science, the systematic study of the inorganic world, as distinct from the study of the organic world, which is the province of biological science. Physical science is ordinarily thought of as consisting of four broad areas: astronomy, physics, chemistry, and the Earth sciences. Each of these is in turn divided into fields and subfields. This article discusses the historical development—with due attention to the scope, principal concerns, and methods—of the first three of these areas. The Earth sciences are discussed in a separate article.<br>

<br>Physics, in its modern sense, was founded in the mid-19th century as a synthesis of several older sciences—namely, those of mechanics, optics, acoustics, electricity, magnetism, heat, and the physical properties of matter. The synthesis was based in large part on the recognition that the different forces of nature are related and are, in fact, interconvertible because they are forms of energy.<br>

<br>The boundary between physics and chemistry is somewhat arbitrary. As it developed< in the 20th century, physics is concerned with the structure and behaviour of individual atoms and their components, while chemistry deals with the properties and reactions of molecules. These latter depend on energy, especially heat, as well as on atoms; hence, there is a strong link between physics and chemistry. Chemists tend to be more interested in the specific properties of different elements and compounds, whereas physicists are concerned with general properties shared by all matter.<br>

<br>Astronomy is the science of the entire universe beyond Earth; it includes Earth’s gross physical properties, such as its mass and rotation, insofar as they interact with other bodies in the solar system. Until the 18th century, astronomers were concerned primarily with the Sun, Moon, planets, and comets. During the following centuries, however, the study of stars, galaxies, nebulas, and the interstellar medium became increasingly important. Celestial mechanics, the science of the motion of planets and other solid objects within the solar system, was the first testing ground for Newton’s laws of motion and thereby helped to establish the fundamental principles of classical (that is, pre-20th-century) physics. <br>Astrophysics, the study of the physical properties of celestial bodies, arose during the 19th century and is closely connected with the determination of the chemical composition of those bodies. In the 20th century physics and astronomy became more intimately linked through cosmological theories, especially those based on the theory of relativity.<br></p>

<h1>Branches of Physical Science.</h1>
<P>The two main types of physical science are physics and chemistry. Physics is the study of how matter is affected by energy. Chemistry is the study of the properties of matter and how it transforms through its interactions with other substances.</P>

    <h3>Physics</h3>
    <p>Physics is the study of matter and energy. Isaac Newton's laws of motion are an integral part of the study of physics. Newton'sfirst law of motion states that an object at rest will remain at rest and that an object in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by a force. A force is a push or a pull. Gravity is considered a force. Gravity is a force that pulls objects toward one another. Friction is also a force. When objects come in contact with one another, a moving object will have the force of friction pushing in the opposite direction of the motion. Friction can take place between any two objects, gases such as air, and fluids such as water. Newton's third law of motion states that for every action, there is an equal, opposing reaction. Using these two laws can help explain why a baseball flies off the bat with such force.When the ball is pitched it does not continue forever in the direction in which it was pitched. This is because the force of the bat sends it in the opposite direction. Likewise, the harder the pitch is thrown, the farther the ball will fly according to Newton's second law of motion, that the ball will react with an equal but opposite force.<br>

<br>Newton's second law of motion gives a formula to figure the acceleration. Newton's second law says that the acceleration of an object can be found by taking the net force and dividing by the mass. <br>If a 0.14 kg baseball is hit with a force of 30,00 Newtons, then the acceleration of the baseball would be found by calculation 30,000 divided by 0.14 for a resulting acceleration of 214,285 meters per second squared<br>.</p>

    <h3>Chemistry</h3>
    <p>Chemistry, the science that deals with the properties, composition, and structure of substances (defined as elements and compounds),<br> the transformationsthey undergo, and the energy that is released or absorbed during these processes. Every substance, whether naturally occurring or artificially produced, consists of one or more of the hundred-odd species of atoms <br> that have been identified as elements. Although these atoms, in turn, are composed of more elementary particles, <br>they are the basic building blocks of chemical substances; <br>there is no quantity of oxygen, mercury, or gold, for example, smaller than an atom of that substance.<br> Chemistry, therefore, is concerned not with the subatomic domain but with the properties of atoms and the laws governing their combinations and how the knowledge of these properties can be used to achieve specific purposes.<br>

<br>The great challenge in chemistry is the development of a coherent explanation of the complex behaviour of materials, why they appear as they do, what gives them their enduring properties, and how interactions among different substances can bring about the formation of new substances and the destruction of old ones. From the earliest attempts to understand the material world in rational terms, chemists have struggled to develop theories of matter that satisfactorily explain both permanence and change. The ordered assembly of indestructible atoms into small and large molecules, or extended networks of intermingled atoms, is generally accepted as the basis of permanence, while the reorganization of atoms or molecules into different arrangements lies behind theories of change. Thus chemistry involves the study of the atomic composition and structural architecture of substances, as well as the varied interactions among substances that can lead to sudden, often violent reactions.<br>

<br>The days are long past when one person could hope to have a detailed knowledge of all areas of chemistry. Those pursuing their interests into specific areas of chemistry communicate with others who share the same interests. Over time a group of chemists with specialized research interests become the founding members of an area of specialization. The areas of specialization that emerged early in the history of chemistry, such as organic, inorganic, physical, analytical, and industrial chemistry, along with biochemistry, remain of greatest general interest. There has been, however, much growth in the areas of polymer, environmental, and medicinal chemistry during the 20th century. Moreover, new specialities continue to appear, as, for example, pesticide, forensic, and computer chemistry.<br></p>
